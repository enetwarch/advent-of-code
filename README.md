# Advent of Code Solutions

This repository contains **my own personal solutions** to [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) (AOC) problems. I aim to improve my fundamentals in programming and computer understanding by completing each problem, which is why **my language choices are mid to low level** like [C](https://www.w3schools.com/c/c_intro.php). A `README.md` file with the instructions and problem link will live alongside the solution for quick problem to solution view. **There will be little to no testing** in this repository as AOC already provides it in their website via input files.
